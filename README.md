# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Code

## 📌 Overview

This repository is a **collection of Python-based projects, notebooks, and scripts** that demonstrate core concepts in data analysis and exploratory data science. It covers **fundamentals (NumPy, Pandas, Arrays)** and applies them to **real-world datasets** like the Titanic dataset.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my **learning journey in Python for Data Analysis** while building practical examples and reusable notebooks.
